# Jellyfin.Plugin.LocalPosters

**Jellyfin.Plugin.LocalPosters** is a plugin for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) that prioritizes the use of local poster images for your media library. This ensures that your personal artwork is displayed instead of automatically downloaded images.

It was heavily inspired by: https://github.com/Drazzilb08/daps (So make sure to check the project)

## Features

- **Local Artwork Priority**: The plugin ensures that any locally stored poster images are used as the primary artwork, providing a personalized experience.
- **GDrive Sync**: Sync GDrive folders using either (OAuth2 or Service Account)

### Creating Client Secrets for GDrive Integration

2. **Create Project:** Click project dropdown, select **New Project**, and name it.
3. **Enable Google Drive API:** Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library** and enable **Google Drive API**.
4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
    - Under **APIs & Services > Credentials**, create **OAuth client ID**.
    - Configure consent screen (**External**, add app name, save).
    - Set **Authorized Redirect URI**: `{YOUR_JELLYFIN_ADDRESS}/LocalPosters/GoogleAuthorization/Callback`. NOTE: if you are using different addresses for local and external network you have to add both addresses. By default, app is going to read [Networking](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/) settings to find base address, otherwise "current" browser address will be used
    - Select **Web application**, download `client_secrets.json`.
5. **Set Scopes:** Add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`.
6. **Publish Application:** Publish the OAuth consent screen for external access. Please note if you use "Test Audience" refresh token will expire withing 7 days, with current scope application won't require "Verification"
7. **Upload Client Secrets:** Place `client_secrets.json` into directory visible for Jellyfin and change Plugin configuration accordingly.

Once configuration is done, plugin will keep syncing folders and searching for missing images in the selected libraries, no manual interaction is required! ðŸ˜Š
